# CP470_GroupProject

FInal Project for CP470

Oftentimes end users are faced with subscriptions they did not intend to have which they end up paying for or they have subscriptions being billed concurrently which they have completely forgotten about. Our Subscription management service addresses this issue and provides for a centralized location for users to keep track of ongoing and active subscription all in one place allowing for more transparency and clarity to end users.

Our app will serve two main purposes: to keep track of all the user’s subscriptions and to remind the user of upcoming payments/renewals. 
When the user first opens the app, they will be able to login or sign up. On the main page, they will see; notifications about the next few payments coming up and options to add new subscriptions, update existing ones, and remove old ones.
In order for a user to add a subscription, they will need to fill in the following fields: name of subscription, payment plan, payment type (automatic or manual), renewal date (if applicable), and payment amount ($). For example:
Netflix, Monthly payments on 1st of every month, Automatic payments, January 1/23, $15
Disney+, Annual payments on February 1 of every year, Manual payments, $80
Our app will keep track of all the user’s subscriptions and when they will be billed next, sending them notifications on the days leading up to a billing due date.
If the subscription has a manual payment type, the user will have the option to check off when they’ve paid the bill, and the app will tell them if the payment is overdue.
